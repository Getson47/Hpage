    <h1 id="about"> Who am I</h1>
    <p id="who">My name is Getson Chirwa and I currently live in Cape Town and I really enjoy working with technology and wanting to learn more about technonolgy.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy reading books, watching intresting documentaries, watchimg movies, series and giving back to the community.</p>
    <p> During the first hard lockdown back in March, we all had free time on our hand to do other activities, I was working in the hospitality industry at the time and due to the travel ban, the hospitality was going through a rough patch jobs were being lost through retrenchement, things were really bad. I was worried about my job so I started doing researh about jobs that will be in demand in the future.</p>
    <p id="why"> I came across coding, being able to build websites and app, this really facinated me, which lead me to wanting to learn more about this. I did my research and I knew this is something that that I want to do.</p>
